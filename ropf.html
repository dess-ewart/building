                    <strong>SPORTSMANSHIP</strong>
                    <br>
                    <p> ♣ The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice
                        the
                        ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator,
                        administrator or
                        referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action
                        regardless of
                        technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.

                    <strong>FIFA FIELD REGULATIONS</strong>
                    <p>
                        <strong>1. DIMENSIONS.</strong> FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
                        within a
                        given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all
                        fields
                        used by teams under 12 and older.
                    </p>
                    <p class="border-1">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>2. COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong> Fields used within the competition program must be a
                        minimum of 100
                        x
                        60
                        yards. Leagues, districts or associations
                        participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
                        field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
                        Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
                        field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
                        dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
                        associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
                        required to play all their games away.
                    </p>
                    <p class="border-1">&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>3. FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS.</strong> a. U-6 play on a field approximately 20
                        X 40 yards with
                        no
                        penalty
                        areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.
                        b. U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.
                        c. U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.
                        d. In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal
                        dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.</p>

                    <p class="border-1">&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>4. TEAM BENCH AREAS</strong>
                        a. Recreation & District Programs
                         The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will
                        be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s
                        bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard
                        away from the touchline and extending to twenty yards (20)
                        both ways from the halfway line. In the event that field

                        2

                        conditions require team benches to be on the same side of
                        the field, a team’s bench area shall consist of that area two
                        (2) yards away from the touchline and extending twenty
                        yards one (1) way from the halfway line.
                         The home team has first choice as to where it wishes to
                        locate its bench area. Coaches and substitutes are required
                        to remain within their bench area during the game. Parents
                        and spectators should occupy the same side of the field as
                        the team they are supporting.
                        b. State Competition League Only
                         Except where it is determined by the referee to be
                        impractical, team bench areas shall be along the same
                        touchline. Each team bench area shall be located two yards
                        outside the touchline, beginning not closer than five yards
                        from midfield and extending not further than twenty yards
                        from midfield. The home team shall have the right to choose
                        the location of its bench area. Coaches and substitutes must
                        remain within their team's bench area during the game.
                         Parents and spectators must occupy the sideline opposite
                        the team bench areas. Supporters of a team must assemble
                        on the side of the midfield facing the team bench area of that
                        team. There shall be a buffer zone extending ten yards on
                        each side of the midfield that may not be occupied by
                        parents or spectators. Match officials shall be empowered to
                        enforce these provisions and may suspend or terminate
                        games in the event that any team, coach, parent, or
                        spectator declines to abide by requests from match officials
                        to comply with these standards.
                    </p>


                    <p class="border-1">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p> <strong>EQUIPMENT</strong>  We will abide by and accept equipment standards as defined by
                        FIFA,
                        USSF and USYSA.
                    </p>

                    <p class="border-1">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p> <strong>NUMBER OF PLAYERS</strong>
                         TEAM SIZE. Except as noted below, team rosters shall consist of not less
                        than eleven nor more than eighteen players. A team must have at least
                        seven (7) players present and able to play before referees are permitted to
                        start a sanctioned game. No more than eleven (11) players per team may
                        be on the field at any one time during the game.
                         SIZE OF AGE GROUP TEAMS. In order to give player’s maximum
                        opportunity to develop in the game of soccer, U-6 through U-1O play
                        modified rules and size of roster as stated in United States Youth Soccer
                        Association (USYSA) rules. It is strongly recommended that U-6 and U-8
                        play 4 v 4. UYSA shall not sanction games involving teams under 10 or
                        younger unless such games are conducted with not more than eight (8)
                        players per side. (National rule 4036 section 2)

                        3

                         Recreational/Developmental players at other ages or where numbers in
                        the playing area are low are strongly encouraged to play small-sided
                        games on reduced field size.
                    </p>
                    <p> <strong>SUBSTITUTIONS</strong>
                         Teams may make an unlimited number of substitutions at the times
                        indicated below. A player who has been replaced may re-enter the game
                        as a substitute at a later time.
                        1. Prior to a throw-in your favor.
                        2. Prior to a goalkick by either team.
                        3. After a goal by either team.
                        4. After an injury, by either team, when the referee stops play.
                        5. At half time.
                        6. When a player has been “cautioned”, only the player receiving
                        “caution” may be substituted.
                    </p>

                    <p class="border-1">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>CONFISCATED PLAYER PASSES
                        </strong>
                         Passes of any individual(s) ejected from any match shall be retained after
                        the match by the referee. The pass of any individual who has received a
                        third caution (yellow card) during a playing year shall be confiscated by
                        the referee at the conclusion of the match in which the third caution was
                        received. That player will be suspended from playing in the next game in
                        which the offending participant would otherwise be eligible to participate.
                        This process will continue so that for every third yellow card received
                        during a playing year, the player will be suspended from playing in the
                        next game (after the receipt of a third yellow card) for which the offending
                        participate would otherwise be eligible to participate. The referee shall
                        deliver all confiscated passes to the UYSA State Office within forty-eight
                        (48) hours of the conclusion of the match.</p>


                    <p class="border-1">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p> <strong> ALL-PLAY</strong>
                         All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play at
                        least fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program are
                        encouraged to play their players 50% of each game.
                        o A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game
                        under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from
                        practice and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or
                        games, and injuries.</p>

                    <p class="border-1">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p> <strong>PLAYERS' EQUIPMENT</strong> Where the uniform colors of both teams are so similar
                        that the referee
                        orders a change, the designated home team must change to colors
                        distinct from those of the opponent.
                    </p>

                    <p class="border-1">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>MIXED TEAMS</strong> <br>
                        <strong> GIRL'S ON BOYS TEAMS.</strong> Girls are eligible to play on boys' teams with
                        parent/guardian
                        permission.
                        <strong>  TYPES OF TEAMS</strong> Teams with females only are Girls Teams. All others are
                        Boys Teams. </p>

                    <p class="border-1">&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>COACHING FROM THE SIDELINES</strong> <br>  Coaching from the sidelines, i.e.,
                        giving direction to
                        one’s own team on
                        points of strategy and position, is permitted provided that:
                        1. No mechanical, electrical or other devices are used to amplify the
                        voice.
                        2. The tone of voice is informative and not a harangue.
                        3. The coaching takes place within the team’s bench area.
                        4. No coach, substitute, player or spectator is to make derogatory
                        remarks or gestures to the referees, linesmen, players, substitutes
                        or spectators.
                        5. No coach, player, substitute or spectator is to use profanity or
                        incite, in any manner, disruptive behavior of any kind.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>GAME TERMINATION</strong>
                         Any game terminated after 15 minutes into the second half by the referee
                        by reason of the elements, or by reason of grave disorder on the part of
                        the coaches, players or spectators of a team that is losing at the point that
                        the game is terminated, shall stand as a completed game. If a team is
                        ahead and the game is called because of their actions they will lose the
                        game 1-0.

                        as a result of

                         Each team must determine whether or not referees are registered prior to
                        the start of each game. Upon request, referees officiating at any game
                        must willingly and without bias, show documentation regarding their
                        certification level and registration standing with the USSF to coach,
                        assistant coach, or team captain of teams participating in that game. Prior
                        to the game a coach may decide to postpone the game if the referees do
                        not produce the requested documentation. The game is to be replayed at
                        a later date.
                         Referees not complying with this section will be referred to the Disciplinary
                        Committee.
